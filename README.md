# Audio-Analysis
Audio Analysis using Python Module Librosa </br>
Audio Analysis to check for cracks and deformitites in solid surfaces by comparing audios of old and new audio analysis</br>

# Description of Audio Analysis Module
Librosa is a module in python used for Audio analysis and displaying different properties of an audio file.</br>
By using this Python based Librosa Module we’re analysing the audio produced by a hammer or a heavy object hitting the surface of the bridge.</br>
This audio will be first recorded with a piece of perfect block of concrete or a perfect part of the bridge. Over time, the audio will be recorded and compared to the old recording of the perfect block </br>
For analysing the audio we will plot the Mel’s Spectrogram over the audio of both, the old audio and the new recorded audio. </br>
We will also find the numerical difference in both the audio files thus finding the percentage difference in the condition of the bridge. How much it has deteriorated over the period of time. </br>
The authority overlooking the condition of the bridge will have the spectrogram of both the old condition of the bridge and the current condition. </br>
This will allow them to find deformities in that particular part of the bridge and take action</br>
